Standing in your neighbour's basement you see a large iron chest which emits a purple glow. 
"That's where he must be hiding the potato!", you say to yourself.

Lvl 1: user has summoned an egg. 

You shout: "That's not a potato! That's an egg!" 
But then you think: "Well, maybe the potato is inside the egg?" 

interactions with the egg: sit on it to keep it warm (3x), knock at the outside of the egg (3x), option to put it in oven  - this will result in the egg being cooked and prompt a game over. 

Lvl 1.5: something is hatching from the summoned egg. 
user sees three eyes through the crack. 
the eyes are either red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, pink, black or white. 
the colour of the eyes indicates the tamagotchi's overall character. 
this has influence on which of tamagotchi's needs are going to be easier or harder to satisfy. 
this will take effect at the start of Lvl 3.

tamagotchi's feedback: 



Update spawns needs every 1 minute instead of every 5 minutes. 
Only one of hunger, tired or poop needs to reach 3 for the spawn to get sick - it's not by chance, the spawn will get sick. 
If the spawn is sick it will tell the user taht it doesn't feel so good. 
There should be a bar for "sick". It appears only if the spawn is sick. When the sick bar reaches 100 the spawn dies. This will end the game.
